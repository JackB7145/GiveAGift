  "fullDescription": "GiveAGift is designed to deliver personalized gift recommendations by leveraging conversational input, embedding-based memory, and context retrieved from a vector database. The memory layer is implemented in Supabase, enabling retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) workflows. Built primarily in TypeScript with a modern stack, the system integrates a vector store for storing prior gift ideas and user context, and an LLM interface for generating suggestions. The architecture emphasises decoupling of the interface, memory module and language model layer so the gift-advice logic stays adaptable as you experiment with different LLMs or memory backends.",
